# Airline Operations & Safety Analysis – SQL Project

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on **analyzing airline operations and aviation safety data using SQL**. The analysis is designed to extract **actionable insights from structured aviation datasets**, answering business and safety-related questions such as **incident trends, airline performance, aircraft risk, and temporal patterns**.

The project demonstrates strong **SQL querying skills**, including filtering, aggregation, joins, cte, case-based logic, and analytical reasoning.

---

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

* Analyze airline operations and aviation safety data
* Perform **EDA-style exploration using SQL** to understand distributions and anomalies
* Clean and standardize raw aviation data using SQL transformations
* Identify trends by airline, aircraft type, severity, and time
* Generate insights suitable for reporting and BI visualization

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & EDA Skills (SQL-Based)

Although the analysis is SQL-driven, the project applies **EDA and data cleaning principles** directly in SQL:

* Handling missing or null values using `CASE`, `COALESCE`, and filters
* Standardizing categorical values (airline names, aircraft types)
* Removing or isolating incomplete / invalid records
* Exploring data distributions using `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `AVG`
* Identifying outliers in fatalities and incident severity

These steps ensure the dataset is **analysis-ready** before deeper insights are derived.

## 🧭 Analysis Steps / Methodology

1. **Data Understanding**
   Reviewed schema, column meanings, and data quality issues.

2. **Data Cleaning (SQL)**
   Cleaned and standardized raw aviation data using SQL conditions and transformations.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   Performed exploratory queries to understand distributions, frequencies, and trends.

4. **Analytical Querying**
   Used aggregations, grouping, and conditional logic to answer business and safety questions.

5. **Insight Interpretation**
   Converted query outputs into operational and safety insights.

## 🧾 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains structured aviation-related information, including:

* Event / Incident Date
* Airline / Operator
* Aircraft Type
* Flight Phase
* Location / Country
* Fatalities and Injury counts
* Aircraft Damage and Risk Indicators

This dataset resembles real-world **aviation safety and operations data** used for risk assessment and compliance analysis.

## 🔄 Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding

* Reviewed dataset structure and column definitions
* Identified key analytical dimensions (airline, aircraft, time, severity)

### 2️⃣ SQL-Based Analysis

The analysis was performed entirely using SQL, focusing on:

* Filtering records by conditions
* Aggregations using `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`
* Grouping by airline, year, aircraft type
* Sorting and ranking results
* Using `CASE WHEN` for classification logic

### 3️⃣ Insight Generation

* Translated query outputs into safety and operational insights

---

## 🧠 Key Analysis Areas (Query Highlights)

### ✈️ Airline-Level Analysis

* Number of incidents per airline
* Comparison of safety records across operators

### 🛩️ Aircraft Analysis

* Incident frequency by aircraft type
* Identification of high-risk aircraft categories

### 📅 Time-Based Analysis

* Year-wise and month-wise incident trends
* Identification of peak risk periods

### ⚠️ Severity & Risk Analysis

* Fatal vs non-fatal incidents
* Severity distribution using conditional logic

---

## 📊 Key Insights

* Certain airlines and aircraft types appear more frequently in incident records
* Incident trends vary significantly over time
* Majority of incidents fall under non-fatal categories, but a small subset contributes to high severity

---

## ⭐ Project Highlights & Skills Demonstrated

* SQL-based **EDA and data cleaning** on real-world aviation data
* Writing analytical queries using `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and subqueries
* Applying `CASE WHEN` logic for severity classification
* Trend analysis using time-based aggregations
* Translating raw SQL output into business and safety insights

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

* Visualize SQL outputs using Power BI or Tableau
* Perform deeper root-cause analysis using additional attributes
