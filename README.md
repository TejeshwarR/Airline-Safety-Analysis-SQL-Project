📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline operations and aviation safety data using SQL. The analysis is designed to extract actionable insights from structured aviation datasets, answering business and safety-related questions such as incident trends, airline performance, aircraft risk, and temporal patterns.
The project demonstrates strong SQL querying skills, including filtering, aggregation, joins, CTE, case-based logic, and analytical reasoning.

🎯 Goals of the Project
•	Analyze airline operations and aviation safety data
•	Perform EDA-style exploration using SQL to understand distributions and anomalies
•	Clean and standardize raw aviation data using SQL transformations
•	Identify trends by airline, aircraft type, severity, and time
•	Generate insights suitable for reporting and BI visualization

🧹 Data Cleaning & EDA Skills (SQL-Based)
Although the analysis is SQL-driven, the project applies EDA and data cleaning principles directly in SQL:
•	Handling missing or null values using CASE, COALESCE, and filters
•	Standardizing categorical values (airline names, aircraft types)
•	Removing or isolating incomplete / invalid records
•	Exploring data distributions using COUNT, MIN, MAX, AVG
•	Identifying outliers in fatalities and incident severity
These steps ensure the dataset is analysis-ready before deeper insights are derived.

🧭 Analysis Steps / Methodology
1.	Data Understanding
Reviewed schema, column meanings, and data quality issues.
2.	Data Cleaning (SQL)
Cleaned and standardized raw aviation data using SQL conditions and transformations.
3.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed exploratory queries to understand distributions, frequencies, and trends.
4.	Analytical Querying
Used aggregations, grouping, and conditional logic to answer business and safety questions.
5.	Insight Interpretation
Converted query outputs into operational and safety insights.

🧾 Dataset Overview
The dataset contains structured aviation-related information, including:
•	Event / Incident Date
•	Airline / Operator
•	Aircraft Type
•	Flight Phase
•	Location / Country
•	Fatalities and Injury counts
•	Aircraft Damage and Risk Indicators
This dataset resembles real-world aviation safety and operations data used for risk assessment and compliance analysis.

🛩️ Aircraft Analysis
•	Incident frequency by aircraft type
•	Identification of high-risk aircraft categories
📅 Time-Based Analysis
•	Year-wise and month-wise incident trends
•	Identification of peak risk periods
⚠️ Severity & Risk Analysis
•	Fatal vs non-fatal incidents
•	Severity distribution using conditional logic
________________________________________
📊 Key Insights
•	Certain airlines and aircraft types appear more frequently in incident records
•	Incident trends vary significantly over time
•	Majority of incidents fall under non-fatal categories, but a small subset contributes to high severity
